OpenCV Tic Tac Toe Engine
=========================

Author: Vegard Haugland <vegard@haugland.at>

How to use
----------

1. Check out repository
2. Create virtual environment in project folder (python3.6 -m venv .)
3. Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run tests (python testBoards.py). All tests should pass.
5. Run game engine (python play.py).

Future work
-----------

1. Improve detection
2. ~Fully integrate with opencv and camera~
3. ~Test with Dobot robot~
4. Implement minimax AI algorithm
5. Dobot mode only supports the player being X at the moment. Increase support for O.
6. Make Dobot return pieces afterwards.
